These are the scripts that I created while in my Java class (IT-145) at SNHU.

All Challenge Activities and Labs are from the zyBooks program. The Class Assignments are what is turned in via online learning systems.

### Challenge Activities

There are quite a few challenges in each chapter and quite a few chapters. You can find the challenges at the following link:

### Labs

<details>
<summary>Chapter 1 Labs</summary>

**Lab 1.37**
\
Asks the user for an integer. Then outputs the users input, then outputs it squared, then cubed. Asks the user for another integer and takes both integers and finds the sum and product. Outputs the sum and product.

**Lab 1.38**
\
Asks the user for an integer, double, character, and string. Outputs the inputs in the following order: integer, double, character, string. Then outputs the inputs in the following order: string, character, double, integer. Then casts the double to an integer and outputs the integer.

<summary>Chapter 2 Labs</summary>

**Lab 2.17**
\
Write a method drivingCost() with input parameters milesPerGallon, dollarsPerGallon, and milesDriven that returns the dollar cost to drive those miles. Define that method in a program whose inputs are the car's miles per gallon and the price of gas in dollars per gallon (both doubles). Output the gas cost for 10 miles, 50 miles, and 400 miles, by calling your drivingCost() method three times.

### Class Assignments
<details>
<summary>Module 2</summary>
We implemented either the Dog.java class or the Cat.java class based on the specifications in the UML Class diagram.

I wrote both the Dog.java class and the Cat.java class for a reference for anyone who may need to use the classes.

**Note:** Both the Dog.java class and the Cat.java class are in the PetBAG package folder as they are part of the PetBAG project later in the class.
