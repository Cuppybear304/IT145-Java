These are the scripts that I created while in my Java class (IT-145) at SNHU.

All Challenge Activities and Labs are from the zyBooks program. The Class Assignments and Projects are what is turned in via the online learning systems.

### Challenge Activities

There are quite a few challenges in each chapter and quite a few chapters. You can find the challenges at the following link:

### Labs

<details>
<summary>Module 1 Labs</summary>

**Lab 1.37**
\
Asks the user for an integer. Then outputs the users input, then outputs it squared, then cubed. Asks the user for another integer and takes both integers and finds the sum and product. Outputs the sum and product.

**Lab 1.38**
\
Asks the user for an integer, double, character, and string. Outputs the inputs in the following order: integer, double, character, string. Then outputs the inputs in the following order: string, character, double, integer. Then casts the double to an integer and outputs the integer.

<summary>Module 2 Labs</summary>

**Lab 2.17**
\
Write a method drivingCost() with input parameters milesPerGallon, dollarsPerGallon, and milesDriven that returns the dollar cost to drive those miles. Define that method in a program whose inputs are the car's miles per gallon and the price of gas in dollars per gallon (both doubles). Output the gas cost for 10 miles, 50 miles, and 400 miles, by calling your drivingCost() method three times.

<summary>Module 3 Labs</summary>

**Lab 3.35**
\
This program outputs a downwards facing arrow composed of a rectangle and a right triangle. The arrow dimensions are defined by user specified arrow base height, arrow base width, and arrow head width.

**Lab 3.36**
\
Given a line of text as input, output the number of characters excluding spaces, periods, exclamation points, or commas.

<summary>Module 4 Labs</summary>

**Lab 4.5**
\
Prompt the user to enter five numbers, being five people's weights. Store the numbers in an array of doubles. Output the array's numbers on one line, each number followed by one space. Also output the total weight, by summing the array's elements. Also output the average of the array's elements. Also output the max array element.

### Class Assignments

<details>
<summary>Module 2</summary>
We implemented either the Dog.java class or the Cat.java class based on the specifications in the UML Class diagram.

I wrote both the Dog.java class and the Cat.java class for a reference for anyone who may need to use the classes.

**Note:** Both the Dog.java class and the Cat.java class are in the PetBAG package folder as they are part of the PetBAG project later in the class.
